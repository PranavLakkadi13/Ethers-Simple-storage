This is a basic Ethers project 

This project shows how we can write,compile,and deploy smart contract on a testnet.
This also has a basic script to interact with the testnet and make function call.

This repo also has a custom script "compile" as mentioned below that you should run before deploying the contract as it creates the ABI and Bytecode of the Contract to be deployed.

```shell
yarn init 

yarn compile 

node deploy.js
```
